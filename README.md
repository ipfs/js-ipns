Implements parsing and serialization of [IPNS Records](https://specs.ipfs.tech/ipns/ipns-record/).

## Example - Create record

```js
import * as ipns from 'ipns'

const ipnsRecord = await ipns.createIPNSRecord(privateKey, value, sequenceNumber, lifetime)
```

## Example - Validate record against public key

```js
import { validate } from 'ipns/validator'

await validate(publicKey, marshalledRecord)
// if no error thrown, the record is valid
```

## Example - Validate record against routing key

This is useful when validating IPNS names that use RSA keys, whose public key is embedded in the record (rather than in the routing key as with Ed25519).

```js
import { ipnsValidator } from 'ipns/validator'

await ipnsValidator(routingKey, marshalledRecord)
```

## Example - Extract public key from record

```js
import * as ipns from 'ipns'

const publicKey = await ipns.extractPublicKeyFromIPNSRecord(peerId, ipnsRecord)
```

## Example - Marshal data with proto buffer

```js
import * as ipns from 'ipns'

const ipnsRecord = await ipns.createIPNSRecord(privateKey, value, sequenceNumber, lifetime)
// ...
const marshalledData = ipns.marshalIPNSRecord(ipnsRecord)
// ...
```

Returns the record data serialized.

## Example - Unmarshal data from proto buffer

```js
import * as ipns from 'ipns'

const ipnsRecord = ipns.unmarshalIPNSRecord(storedData)
```

Returns the `IPNSRecord` after being deserialized.

# Install

```console
$ npm i ipns
```

## Browser `<script>` tag

Loading this module through a script tag will make its exports available as `Ipns` in the global namespace.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/ipns/dist/index.min.js"></script>
```
